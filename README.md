# Credit_Risk

#### Given the data set invloing credit history, I try to come up with the best fit models to classify good or bad credit risks. 

After removing nulls and outliers, I seperate the data into training and testing. I use the SVM Model and the Decision Tree Model to determine if credit history is an improtant factor.
